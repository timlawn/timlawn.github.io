I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the Athinoula A. Martinos Center where I currently combine ultra-high field functional imaging of the brainstem and functional networks to investigate how dysfunction of neuromodulatory systems give rise to the earliest neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.

During my PhD in the Center for Neuroimaging Sciences at King's College London I worked on novel multi-modal approaches to combine molecular information from PET into BOLD fMRI analyses to investigate psychopharmacology, consciousness, and neuropsychiatric disorders.

## Research Focus

I investigate how the brain's neuromodulatory neurotransmitter systems shape broader network dynamics, how this is altered across various disorders, and how we can intervene in these processes with precision medicine.

### Current Projects

**Multi-modal Neuroimaging**  
Combining PET molecular imaging with fMRI to understand neurotransmitter-network relationships across psychiatric disorders and consciousness states.

**Brainstem Imaging**  
3T and 7T imaging of brainstem nuclei to characterize neuromodulatory system dysfunction in preclinical stages of Alzheimer's disease and its relationship to cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms.

**Machine Learning**  
Normative and prediction modeling using molecular-enriched networks to parse heterogeneity in symptomatology and treatment response.

**Psychopharmacology**  
Bridging the gap between the molecular-level mechanisms of drugs and their systems-level effects on networks.
