I investigate how the brain's neuromodulatory neurotransmitter systems shape broader network dynamics, how this is altered across various disorders, and how we can intervene in these processes with precision medicine.

My current work as a postdoctoral research fellow at the Athinoula A. Martinos Center combines functional brainstem imaging with network science to investigate how the neuromodulatory systems give rise to the heterogeneous early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.

During my PhD in the Center for Neuroimaging Sciences at King's College London, I worked on novel multi-modal approaches to combine molecular information from PET into BOLD fMRI analyses to investigate psychopharmacology, consciousness, and neuropsychiatric disorders.

When not doing neuroscience, thinking about neuroscience, or arguing about neuroscience at the pub, you can probably find me climbing, on a motorbike, or off on an adventure somewhere.
